### Backend
- Set up a clean Express project

- Connected to MongoDB using Mongoose

- Defined a Ticket model with validation

- Implemented all RESTful endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

- Added robust error handling and middleware structure

- Tested everything with Postman

- Deployed good development practices (e.g., .env, .gitignore, modular middleware)


### Frontend
- Created the frontend using Vite + React.

- Installed Axios for making HTTP requests.

- Built a simple UI to list all tickets.

- Used a service file (ticketService.js) to manage API calls.

- Fetched data with useEffect on app load.

- Handled no tickets case with a fallback message.
